		title: "Nuclear computation",
		summary: "Nuclear computation is a type of computation which allows threads to either spawn new threads or converge many threads to one. The aim of nuclear computation is to take advantage of threading abilities of modern multi-core processors where the trend is to increase their hardware ability to compute more threads then their earlier generation processors."+'<br><br>'+"Nuclear computation focuses on real time processing for things like multimedia such as processing audio where a real time deadline (the sample rate in Hz) exists. For that reason it should not block and computational processes which alter shared memory must be atomic (excuted in one clock cycle without locking)."+'<br><br>'+"Nuclear computation allows a computational thread to use thread fission to turn one thread into many or thread fusion to turn many threads into one.",

		title: "Virtual environment",
		summary: 'Any networked application that permits both interaction with the computing environment and the work of other users. Email, chat, web-based document sharing applications are all examples of virtual environments. Simply put, it is a networked common operating space. Once the fidelity of the virtual environment is such that it "creates a psychological state in which the individual perceives himself or herself as existing within the virtual environment" (Blascovich, 2002, pg 129) then the virtual environment (VE) had progressed into the realm of immersive virtual environments (IVEs).',
